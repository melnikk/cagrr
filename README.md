Prerequisites

1. `nodetool` installed (on your host)
2. *OR* `mx4j` interface activated (on cassandra node)
3. *OR* `jolokia` agent installed (on cassandra node)

You may control connection type via `-c` flag, default connector is `mx4j`.

Setup test environment
----------------------

Initialize test Cassandra 2.2 cluster (you need ansible, docker and docker-compose installed):

```
make setup
```

Run tests:

```
make test   # Make a "hole" and check existence
```
```
make check  # Only check, no write/restart cycle
```

Repair your cluster:

```
make run
```

Analyze your logs in [Kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana) interface available at:

	Run on your host machine:
	```
	sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
	```
